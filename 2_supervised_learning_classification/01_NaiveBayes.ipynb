        "The NumPy library for Python concentrates on handling extensive multi-dimensional data and the intricate mathematical functions operating on the data. NumPy offers speedy computation and execution of complicated functions working on arrays. Few of the points in favor of NumPy are:\n",

        "- Support for mathematical and logical operations\n",
        "- Shape manipulation\n",
        "- Sorting and Selecting capabilities\n",
