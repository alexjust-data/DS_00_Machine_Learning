### What is Colab

[Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html), or “Colab” for short, is a product from Google Research. Colab allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs. 

### Requirements

The only requirement for Colab is to have a Google Account. You can use your UOC account which is linked to google.

We recommend follow the official [Welcome To Colaboratory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). It provides the basics of Colab as well as useful links to working examples.

### Main characteristics of colab

- Files are stored as python notebooks (.ipynb)
- Notebooks are automatically saved in Google drive, which makes it easy to share documents online.
- Notebooks are organized in cells:
    - Code cells: executable Python scripts
    - Text cells: rich text, images, HTML, LaTeX with information about the code
- Cell order does not matter, execution order does. Execution order is depicted by the number between [] located at the left side of each cell.
- It supports Python 3 (Python 2 is no longer supported)
- Colab works with most major browsers, and is most thoroughly tested with the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
